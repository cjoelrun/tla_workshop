# tla_workshop

This is the complete set of materials for my rax.io TLA+ workshop.

The contents of this workshop are generally based on Leslie Lamport's [video series](http://lamport.azurewebsites.net/video/videos.html). 

The complete workshop slides are available either in their original Keynote format, zipped into `tla_workshop.zip`.

The cheat sheet with common TLA+ idioms and syntax (as covered in the workshop) is in `tla_cheatsheet.pdf`.

The TLA+ spec files used in the workshop can be found in the `specs/` directory.
